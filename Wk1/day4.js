// Most Expensive Groceries
/*
You are compiling a price checker for a grocery store. The grocery prices are as 
follows: butter: $1, eggs: $2, milk: $3, bread: $4, cheese: $5
First, create a function called costOfGroceries(groceries) which takes a single 
array of grocery items and returns the total cost.
Then, write a function mostExpensiveGroceries(groceriesList) that takes in a 2-dimensional 
array of grocery items and returns the index of the sub-array with the highest cost.

//StringChanger
/*
Build a function called stringChanger() that takes in two arguments: a word and 
an operation. Based on the operation, your function will return the word modified 
in some way. The operations are:
'capitalize': Capitalize the first letter in the word.
'uppercase': Capitalize every letter in the word.
'double': Return the word twice in a row.
'reverse': Return the string with the letters in reverse order.
If the operation is invalid, return the word, unchanged.
